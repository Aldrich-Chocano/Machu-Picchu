## History of Machu Picchu
> The history of Machu Picchu began when the Inca empire built this citadel as a safe haven to worship the many gods of the Incas. According to Wikipedia, this citadel also served as a royal estate for all of the Inca emperors and nobles as a recreational place. However, this recreational place needed to be suitable for emperors, so they needed the citadel to have food, water, and shelter all accessible at the top of a giant mountain. The Incas method of irrigation was made up of canals that descended down the mountain side to water the crops. However, this method would sometimes fail as the water would cause landslides to happen and the crops would be destroyed. The crops that were mainly grown were maize, cotton, and coca which were used for a variety of purposes. For instance, the cotton could be used to to make rugs, blankets, or clothing. The Incas would raise livestock which were primarily made up of llamas. The reason for this is because their wool would also be used to make clothing to keep the Incas warm when winter came. The buildings were made of dry-stone walls which did not have mortar to stick them together, but instead had the stones shaped to fit perfectly with each other. It is unknown how the Incas carried these large stones up the mountain to build this citadel which makes Machu Picchu so mystical. After all of the infrastructure for the center of Machu Picchu was created, the Incas would build temples around the citadel for people to pray and worship their gods. Some temples even required the person to walk long distances to reach it such as the Sun temple which was at the very edge of one of the mountains of Machu Picchu. Eventually, Machu Picchu was deserted by the Incas because they could not maintain the citadel with resources from the Inca empire since it fell to Francisco Pizarro and his Spanish army. After many years, Machu Picchu could not be found by any explorer because of the vegetation that grew around the citadel to hide its location. Eventually Machu Picchu was discovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham III, and was later on was voted to be one of the seven wonders of the world in 2007.
