## History of Machu Picchu
The history of Machu Picchu began when the Incan empire built this citadel as a safe haven to worship their many gods. This also served as a "royal estate for all of the Incan emperors and nobles" as a recreational place (History 3).
The infrastructure of this place is made up of canals that descended down the mountain side to water the crops. The buildings are made of "dry-stone walls"
