## History of Machu Picchu
> The history of Machu Picchu began when the Incan empire built this citadel as a safe haven to worship their many gods. According to Wikipedia, this citadel also served as a royal estate for all of the Incan emperors and nobles as a recreational place. However, this recreational place needed to be suitable for emperors, so they needed the citadel to have food, water, and shelter all accesible at the top of a giant mountain. The Incans method of irrigation was made up of canals that descended down the mountain side to water the crops. The crops that were mainly grown were maize, cotton, and coca which were used for a variety of purposes. For instance, the cotton could be used to to make rugs, blankets, or clothing. The Incans would raise livestock which were primarily made up of llamas. The reason for this is because their wool would also be used to make clothing to keep the Incans warm when winter came. However, this method would somethimes fail as the water would cause landslides to happen and the crops would be destroyed. The buildings were made of dry-stone walls which did not have mortar to stick them together, but instead had the stones shaped to fit perfectly with each other.
